# Arabic-Language-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis




This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Arabic language tweets using machine learning techniques. The objective of this project is to automatically classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed in the tweet.



* The first step of the project is to retrieve the tweets containing specific keywords, hashtags, or mentions from the Twitter API using the Tweepy library. The tweets are then preprocessed by cleaning, tokenizing, and lemmatizing the text.

* The second step of the project is to extract features from the preprocessed tweets using the bag-of-words model with TF-IDF weighting. This model represents each tweet as a vector of word frequencies weighted by their importance in the corpus.

* The third step of the project is to train and evaluate a machine learning classifier on the extracted features using the scikit-learn library.
* We used Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression Algorithm classifiers.
